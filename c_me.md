# making sense of my scripts: 
'pickle_rick.py' - data clean-up
'session.py' - exploratory of session duration (to be revisited, consider removing sessions that are too short)
'(b)(d)lay_me.py' - exploratory of delay duration (more useless than me)
'social_status_bb.py' - aligned task attempts with available elo scores & processed rts/proportions (saved 2 tonkean_table_elo.xlsx for further processing) 
'(h)e(l)lo.py' - ugleh proportion/rt plots wrt elo scores (tonkeans only) NOT FINISHED
'24:24.py' - exploratory of session frequencies across day/week(?)/months
'24:24forALL.py' - what it sounds like 
'performance.py' - overall proportions per monkey + session-level proportions per monkey 
'restrain_me.py' - final-ish plots
